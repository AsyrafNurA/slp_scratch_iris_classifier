# slp_scratch_iris_classifier
Building a Single Layer Perceptron classifier for doing a classification on Iris Dataset. Since it could only differentiate data into two classes, I only use iris-setosa and iris-virginica. The dataset was preprocessed through the spreadsheets first, before being used in the program.
